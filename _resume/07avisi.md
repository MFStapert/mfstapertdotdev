During my tenure at Avisi I worked on a multitude of project in various team compositions

The first project I did at Avisi was for notaries. It was a major refactor of an existing mission critical application, the goal was to decouple 2 intertwined applications.
Also upgrading all existing technology and dependencies to current (company) standards.

My next project was for a customer in the telecom industry; we were brought on board to rewrite their existing administration application.
We rewrote an existing microservice architecture to a module based back-end.
Reasons being reduced complexity and accelerated development.
The front-end was also refactored to accommodate a redesign and simplifications.
All rewriting work was done while keeping all old functionality up and running and also adding new features.

The subsequent project was for a startup seeking to develop a questionnaire tool.
This tool would allow companies to find an implementation partner for various software packages.

I finished my career working on a startup that aimed to reduce emissions for festivals.

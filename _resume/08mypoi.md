MyPoiWorld is a custom software party that serves customers in the tourism, construction and logistics sector. The assignment I was hired for was to review the existing frontend architecture and implement improvements in the test strategy. I achieved this while working with the team to realize a ticket system for tourism and an order management system for logistics. During this process I also took the lead on various improvements in the field of infrastructure.

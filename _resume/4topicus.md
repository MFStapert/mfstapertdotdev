Worked in a team that maintained and developed a debtor registration system. 
The system is applicable to multiple markets such as mortgages and
invoicing. In addition, it’s applicable as back-office for one of the Netherlands’ biggest retailers.
Because of the diversity of customers, it is necessary that the system runs on multiple types of
application servers – such as websphere and wildfly – and multiple types of database – like Oracle
and PostreSQL.

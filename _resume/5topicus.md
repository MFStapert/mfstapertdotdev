Started development on a new system for teachers in primary education.
The system is a piece of productivity software which connects to an existing administration application and a learning platform, it also has its own own back-end.
The system allows teachers to make plans based on test results and or learning goals, gives insight into test results and allows maintenance of school groups.
Challenges of the project were coupling with an existing legacy system and transforming very disparate data into useful information.

Current project for a new customer; we were brought on board to rewrite their existing administration application. We rewrote an existing microservice architecture to a modullith for various reasons. Front-end was also rewritten to accommodate a redesign and simplifications.
All rewriting work was done while keeping all old functionality up and running.

Currently working with the customer to accelerate their business.
